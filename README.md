The final project I chose to do was to make an online game/website that gives you a random element in SPDF notation and you have to type in what element it is into a text box. "Every time you guess an element correctly the score will go up by one but if you get it wrong there will be a pop up page that tells you that you were wrong and gives you the correct element. There is also an option to restart the game if you want too.
